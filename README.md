# CRM_Sprint2

The Customer Relationship Management System is built to control the company interactions with current and future customers. 

The system can be used to organize, automate, and synchronize the service calls information. 

The customer relationship manager needs to keep track of the current and future customers and service calls or complaints registered by them. 

Different reports can be viewed on collected data.

# Technical requirement
Design the system using OOPs. Use C++ programming language to implement.
Use STL, algorithms and iterators to read and store data from text files to data structures. At the end, data in STL should be written back in same text files.
Use file input/output operations to read customers, service requests data.
Use exception handling to validate data and handle exceptions.
Use dynamic memory allocation.

# Non functional requirement
Multi-file multi-directory solution is expected. Modular and maintainable code (comments) and all coding standards should be followed.
makefile to build application. Two-step compilation process - .o and then executable should be generated. .o files to be stored under “obj” sub-directory of project directory.
Use valgrind tool on application executable to detect memory leak. Final valgrind report to be submitted in “reports” directory.
Class diagram, sequence diagram, usecase diagrams.
Use CPPunit to automate unit testing. At least 1 or 2 testcases using CPPunit. Other testcases can be tested manually.
HLD, LLD of the system
RTM, Plan, Presentation 
Unit test cases (at least 10 test cases per module) and Integration test cases in UT_IT document. Both types of test cases i.e. sunny and rainy should be present in this document
